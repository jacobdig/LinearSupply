IN PROGRESS

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design a lab bench power supply which can provide at least 28V at 4A. The supply should be controlled through a microcontroller, and eventually should be able to be controlled through a serial connection. Over voltage and over current protection will be implemented, and a buck converter will be used prior to the linear stage to improve overall efficiency.

## Educational Value Added

As a computer engineer, I never took a power class, but have always been interested in designing power supplies. This project will give me an opportunity to design both a buck converter and a linear supply, learning about power supply PCB design along the way. I will also learn to implement PID and serial control through a microcontroller, with the final product beign a versitile and useful peice of lab equipment.
